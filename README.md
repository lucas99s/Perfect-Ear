# perfect-ear

Perfect Ear is a tool that helps you practice getting music notes by ear in a different way.

It will give you a random music with a raffled tone (it can be the original tone or any other tone), and at the final, you can compare the notes you got from hear with the notes of the tone raffled.

Also it will provide the transpose value (to play in a diferent tone, but still sounding the same notes as the original tone), so even in the different tone, you can still play along with the music.

This is an ongoing project and there are many things planned to be implemented in it.
